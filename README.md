# CS305_FitnessApp

This program will allow users to be able to choose every muscle group and it will throw specific workouts depending on the selection.
his specific application would select a part of the body and highlight each muscle group in that area. 
For example, The triceps have three heads, the long head, medial head and the lateral head. 
Most of the fitness apps just select a group like triceps, and give a huge list of workouts in general for triceps.
Sometimes, when a user is looking in to doing workouts, this way is not as effective because they might end up doing 3 workouts for the long head when in reality, anyone that works out wants to get the most out of the process. 
The user interface would be smooth where it could highlight the specific parts as you press them or if on a browser, cursor over them. When selected, it should sort the workouts most effective for that bodypart with a gif to show the movement.
